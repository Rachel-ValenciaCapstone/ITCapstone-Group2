Project Description:
Develop a web application that allows users to share and discover recipes, as well as plan meals for themselves and their families. The platform will enable users to create accounts, upload recipes, search for recipes based on ingredients, and plan weekly meals. The application will emphasize collaboration and help users make informed meal choices.
How Criteria will be Met:
User Registration and Login: Implement a user registration and login system for individuals to create accounts, log in, and access the features of the platform.
Recipe Upload and Sharing: Users can create their own recipes, complete with ingredients, instructions, and images. The recipes will be stored in the database and accessible to others.
Recipe Search: Develop a search functionality that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. The application should suggest recipes that match the available ingredients.
Meal Planning: Enable users to create and save meal plans for the week. Users can select recipes from the platform's collection and organize them into daily meal plans.
Collaboration: Implement social features that allow users to follow each other, comment on recipes, and share their meal plans with friends and family.
Database Management: Set up a database to store user profiles, recipes, and meal plans. Connect the application to 00webhosting's database services.
Repository and Code Management: Store the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a repository for version control and collaborative development.
Project Management: Maintain a Gantt chart and all tasks in ClickUp for ease of collaboration, prioritization, and delegation. 
Project Benefits:
This project addresses the practical need for meal planning and encourages healthy eating habits. It showcases the skills acquired during the program while providing a valuable tool for users who want to discover new recipes, make efficient use of ingredients, and plan their meals effectively.
